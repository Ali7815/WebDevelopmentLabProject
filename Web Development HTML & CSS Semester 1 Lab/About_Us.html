<h3>   Historic Profile  </h3>
  <p>
The University of Engineering and Technology (main) located in the northern part of Lahore on the historical "Grand Trunk Road (G.T. Road)", near the magnificent Shalimar Gardens built during the great Mughal Empire.
The institution started its career in 1921 as the ‘ Mughalpura Technical College ’. Later it became the ‘Maclagan Engineering College’, a name given to it in 1923 when Sir Edwards Maclagan, the then Governor of the Punjab who laid the foundation stone of the main building, now called the Main Block, which still retains its majesty despite the wear and tear of over eight decades. At that stage the institution offered courses of study in only two disciplines; Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.

Keeping in view the upcoming power crises situation in the country, in 2004 the University established its own Power Generation Unit with capacity of 2 Mega Watts later enhanced to 3 Mega Watts and became first and only countrywide educational institution who has its own Power Generation Unit

To meet the growing demands for the Engineering graduates and allied disciplines in the country, the University started an expansion program in the new millennium. Consequently the teaching and research capacity of the UET-Main was enhanced and the establishment of the satellite campuses was taken up . At present, the University has three satellite campuses; the Faisalabad Campus, the Kala-Shah-Kaku Campus, and the Rachna College .
